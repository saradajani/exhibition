				<h2 style="font-size:45px">Coding the Past!</h2><br><p style="font-size:20px">The first project we worked on this semester was the coding the past project. This project consisted of projects from Daramola's class, Noel's class, and we coded this website in Donald's class. In Daramola's class we got to interview anyone we weanted, I did my family, yet they had to be over 21. We recorded the interview, we asked a total of 10 questions. After we finished our interview recording, we had to transcribe the recording however we wanted to, I color coded mine. After we have finished the interview, we took note of places mentioned in the interview and plotted the locations on a map. As for Noel's class, we created a subject-layered portrait using Adobe Photoshop. Taking information from our interview, we gathered twenty-five photos about our interviewee. We collaged and blended the 25 photos to create a portrait of our interviewee. We also wrote an essay that explains, develops, and circles around a big idea we got from our interview. It could be anything you heard in the interview, I chose to write about the Palestinian Israeli Conflict.

				<h2 style="font-size:45px">A Timely Solution!></h2><br><p style="font-size:20px">The second project we worked on was A Timely Solution. In Daramola's class we were assigned a machine invented during the Industrial Revolution, with this machine, our group came up with a company name. Our company had to first research the Cotton Gin, we each assigned ourselves to research different things about the Cotton Gin. With all the research we gathered, we created an annotated bibliography. Before we went into building the Cotton Gin, we sketched a prototype. After the sketch was finished, we built a model. As for in Noel's Class, I got to chose the topic social media and family. I researched the topic using two articles given, this research helped me create my poem and collage. We created a poem and collage based on Social Media and Family.</p>
