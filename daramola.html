				<h2 style="font-size:30px">What is the Interview Transcript?</h2><br><p style="font-size:20px">The Interview Transcript is a document where we had to make a written transcript of the recorded interview. We had to type out the whole interview word by word, yet we got to exclude statements/words we felt like were not necessary. We had to type out what the interviewee and interviewer said. We got to color code our interview, so that it is clear who is talking in the transcript.</p>

				<h2 style="font-size:30px">What is the Interview Audio?</h2><br><p style="font-size:20px">The interview audio is the recording of the interview that we had with our interviewee. The interview audio consisted of, I, the interviewee asking a total of ten questions to my interviewee. Out of those ten questions, eight were required and given by Daramola. Yet, as for the other two, we had to create our own questions. </p>

				<h2 style="font-size:30px">What is the Map?</h2><br><p style="font-size:20px">We used a map of the world to match specific locations noted in our interview. For example, my interviewee talked about where he was born and where he grew up. I took note of that and plotted that location on a map. Also, my interviewee talked about his ethnicity and those countries are something I plotted.</p>
