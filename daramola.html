				<h2 style="font-size:30px">What is the Interview Transcript?</h2><br><p style="font-size:20px">The Interview Transcript is a document where we had to make a written transcript of the recorded interview. We had to type out the whole interview word by word, yet we got to exclude statements/words we felt like were not necessary. We had to type out what the interviewee and interviewer said. We got to color code our interview, so that it is clear who is talking in the transcript.</p>

				<h2 style="font-size:30px">What is the Interview Audio?</h2><br><p style="font-size:20px">The interview audio is the recording of the interview that we had with our interviewee. The interview audio consisted of, I, the interviewee asking a total of ten questions to my interviewee. Out of those ten questions, eight were required and given by Daramola. Yet, as for the other two, we had to create our own questions. </p>

			<div class="box f">
				<h2 style="font-size:30px">What is the Map?</h2><br><p style="font-size:20px">We used a map of the world to match specific locations noted in our interview. For example, my interviewee talked about where he was born and where he grew up. I took note of that and plotted that location on a map. Also, my interviewee talked about his ethnicity and those countries are something I plotted.</p>

			<div class="box b">
				<h2 style="font-size:30px">What is the sketch?</h2><br><p style="font-size:20px">Using CAD technology, we had tp sketch a draft of our technology which was the Cotton Gin. The sketch was important because it gave us to protype to base our model off of. Also, it was a base foundation of how the Cotton Gin would turn out to be. It is important to shade and know how to hold the pencil when you are sketching.</p>

			<div class="box d">
				<h2 style="font-size:30px">What is the model?</h2><br><p style="font-size:20px">We had to create a replica of the Cotton Gin. It showed our mastery of whether we know the parts or process. It also gave visual representation of what the cotton gin may look like in person, the parts, or how it works for the audience. It was also a very eye catching way of explaining our project to the audience.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="box f">
				<h2 style="font-size:30px">What are the presentation slides?</h2><br><p style="font-size:20px"> We had to create a Press Release announcing our new technology for display at Exhibition. We introduced our company with our slides, and displayed all the work we have done. In the slides we mentioned the significance of our product, meaning why it is the best. We also had two slides per person regarding their contributions to the project. For example, we had a slide for the research they had done which contributed to our bibliography. We also included their contribution to the model, sketch, management log, or slides.</p>
